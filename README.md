# BioGNN

---

Deep learning model to predict biological activity of organic molecules. The project leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to exploit the natural representation of molecules as graphs (atoms = nodes, bonds = edges), with a pipeline that include data collection from ChemBL and feature extraction from RDKit.

This project is part of the final project for the Le Wagon Data Science & AI bootcamp.
